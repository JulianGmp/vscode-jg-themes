# Some Custom Themes

[![Visual Studio Marketplace Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/JulianGmp.jg-themes.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JulianGmp.jg-themes)

This package is a small collection of vscode colour themes that I personally use.

*Right now there's only one but I'm gonna add more at some point, I think. Don't quote me on it.*

## Themes

All Theme names have a `[JG]` prefix.
